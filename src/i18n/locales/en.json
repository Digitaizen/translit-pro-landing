    "questions": {
      "whatIsTransliteration": {
        "question": "What is transliteration?",
        "answer": "Transliteration is the process of converting text from one script to another. TranslitPro converts Latin characters (like \"privet\") into other scripts (like \"привет\" in Russian) in real-time as you type."
      },
      "whichLanguages": {
        "question": "Which languages are supported?",
        "answer": "TranslitPro has 13+ languages built-in: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Greek, Lithuanian, Tajik, Rusyn, Kazakh, and more. You can also add your own custom languages and keyboard layouts."
      },
      "mobileOrDesktop": {
        "question": "Is TranslitPro for mobile or desktop?",
        "answer": "TranslitPro is primarily designed for desktop users. Mobile users typically have built-in keyboards for different scripts. Our app works best on desktop browsers where you want to type in non-Latin scripts using your standard keyboard."
      },
      "whatIsBookmarklet": {
        "question": "What is the bookmarklet?",
        "answer": "The bookmarklet (Pro only) lets you type in your target script directly on most websites. It works on social media, forums, and many web apps. Note: It doesn't work on sites with strict Content Security Policy (CSP) like Google services (Gmail, Docs, etc.)."
      },
      "beyondTransliteration": {
        "question": "What can I do beyond transliteration?",
        "answer": "TranslitPro includes a powerful rich text editor, translation to multiple languages, AI-powered spellcheck in your target language, and export to TXT, RTF, HTML, Markdown, DOCX, or PDF."
      },
      "freeTrial": {
        "question": "Is there a free trial?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can use the basic transliteration features completely free, forever. When you sign up, you also get a trial of Pro features including the bookmarklet, AI spellcheck, and cloud storage."
      },
      "addOwnLanguage": {
        "question": "Can I add my own language?",
        "answer": "Yes! With a Basic plan or higher, you can create custom transliteration schemas and keyboard layouts for any language. Perfect if you need a specific romanization system or a language not built into the app."
      },
      "cancelAnytime": {
        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. You'll continue to have access to paid features until the end of your billing period."
