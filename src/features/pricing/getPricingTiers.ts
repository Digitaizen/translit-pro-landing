/**
 * Centralized pricing configuration for the landing page.
 *
 * This module is intentionally the single source of truth for all plan prices,
 * so price updates do not require editing multiple i18n locale files.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Only numeric/currency values live here; period labels remain in i18n.
 * - Both the raw numeric amounts and their formatted (with currency symbol)
 *   representations are exposed so that the UI can style the number and
 *   currency text separately. This is important for integrations like
 *   browser translation extensions, which may translate the currency symbol
 *   into a word (e.g. "$" → "dollar") and should not inherit the large
 *   font-size used for the numeric amount.
 *
 * @returns An object containing pricing data for each tier, including the
 *          shared currency symbol, numeric amounts, and formatted strings.
